How does email work?	 Email, short for electronic mail, is a method of exchanging digital messages over the internet or other computer networks. Here's a simplified overview of how email works: Creation: The sender composes an email message using an email client (e.g., Outlook, Gmail). They specify the recipient's email address, subject, message content, and any attachments. \n\nSending: When the sender clicks "Send," their email client connects to an outgoing email server (SMTP server). The email server processes the message and sends it to the recipient's email server. \n\nRouting: The recipient's email server receives the message and stores it temporarily. It then determines the recipient's mailbox and routes the message there. \n\nStorage: The email is stored in the recipient's mailbox until they check their email. Most email servers use protocols like IMAP or POP to allow users to retrieve their messages. \n\nRetrieval: The recipient uses an email client (e.g., Outlook, webmail) to access their mailbox. The client connects to the recipient's email server and retrieves the email, displaying it to the recipient. \n\nReading and Reply: The recipient can read the email, reply to it, forward it, or perform other actions. When they send a reply, the process repeats with the roles of sender and recipient reversed. \n\nEmail relies on standardized protocols like SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending messages and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP3 (Post Office Protocol) for retrieving messages. These protocols ensure that emails can be exchanged between different email servers and clients. 	responce - Copy.txt		[]	False	[]	506	genral

What should I provide to my staff to reduce internal threats?	The best way to beproactive and prevent cyber attacks before they can manifest into anythingunmanageable is to educate your employees. By providing awareness training on aregular basis, this will embed cyber security culture into the workforce andminimise internal threats.\n\nManyregulatory bodies are now pushing for businesses to educate their employeesaround cyber security including the Financial conduct Authority.  \n\nIn a [report published last month](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/research/cyber-security-industry-insights.pdf), the FCA urged businesses to tackle staff awareness training at all levels and to ensure the lessons are simple and appropriate to the environment that employees work in.\n\n### Latest Articles	https://mitigatecyber.com/faqs-in-cyber-security/		[]	False	[]	655	w
Cyber Security FAQ	[Cyber security](https://foresite.com/) certainly seems like a straightforward concept from the outset, right? It’s all about safeguarding your data from hackers and their various malware. Of course, once you dig just a little deeper you find out that threats to cyber security come from many more fronts than just the typical external one. Human error is still one of the highest contributing factors to compromised computer systems, only second to phishing/malware, which is reliant on human error. Once you realize some of the largest data breaches happen because of simple mistakes made by employees at opportune moments, things get a lot more complicated.\n\nThe best way to be proactive and prevent cyber attacks before they can manifest into anything unmanageable is to educate ourselves. Once we have the basic and most frequent questions answered, we are ready to make calculated decisions about security policies. In that vein, here’s a brief discussion of some frequently asked questions about data security.\n\n![Img]()	https://foresite.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cyber-security-2/		[]	False	[{"DisplayOrder":0,"QnaId":657,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"How Does Good Cyber Security Operate?"},{"DisplayOrder":1,"QnaId":658,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"What Is the Best Way to Train for Cyber Security?"},{"DisplayOrder":2,"QnaId":659,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"What Are the Costs of a Cyber Attack?"}]	656	d
How Does Good Cyber Security Operate?	Even if you aren’t the most tech-savvy person at your company, you know the importance of cyber security to the success (or even the survival) of your business. But since cyber crime is evolving at such a rapid pace, it’s a given that one of the top questions regarding security is what are the best practices? What constitutes good cyber security?\n\nImproving employee awareness of good [cyber hygiene](http://cybersecurityforum.com/cybersecurity-faq/what-is-cyber-hygiene.html) regarding the use of the company network and the strength of the network’s infrastructure itself are vital. Good cyber hygiene consists of (but is not limited to): instilling good habits about things like strong password policies, avoiding connection to secure company systems via insecure personal devices, and mixing personal documents and emails with work-related ones.\n\nA good way to ensure that cyber hygiene and secure network infrastructure is achieved is to enlist the expert opinion of [security consultants who can assess for risks](https://foresite.com/testing-assessments/) within your company’s systems and organization.	https://foresite.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cyber-security-2/		[]	False	[]	657	d
What Is the Best Way to Train for Cyber Security?	It’s often asked what ways one can enforce best security practices. Even if you are teaching yourself good cyber hygiene, the key emphasis is on the word “practice.” It’s not enough to just gain the knowledge of what best security practices are. It’s key to put that knowledge to work so that you’re actively improving you and other employees’ habits.\n\nOne great example of practical training for cyber security is having a security partner like Foresite attempt a [scheduled mock-cyber attack](https://foresite.com/social-engineering/) on the company system. This is considered white-hat penetration, which is when tech professionals execute a hacking attempt as part of the [risk assessment](https://foresite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cyberriskassessmentinfographic.png) process. This prepares you and your company for a real threat (especially of the social engineering type) and identifies exactly where your vulnerabilities are within your organization and digital infrastructure. And since it’s based on the information collected during the risk assessment (with the express permission of a corporate IT contact), the results of this mock-attack are very accurate. Once these vulnerabilities are known, you and your employees will have practical experience in responding to, as well as mitigating, future attacks.\n\n![Img]()	https://foresite.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cyber-security-2/		[]	False	[]	658	d
What Are the Costs of a Cyber Attack?	With all the news stories in recent years about big organizations and data breaches, we have a general idea of what cyber attacks cost. Money and reputations are lost, which impacts the survival of a business. CEOs have had to step down from their jobs on several occasions. But there are [hidden costs to an attack](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/finance/articles/cfo-insights-seven-hidden-costs-cyberattack.html) that tend to emerge later when dealing with the incident. For one, mission-critical data and technology might be disrupted during the recovery process, which halts important progress at work. And the longer that your system is remedying its compliancy, the costs of an attack become steeper. In the end, keeping your networks secure is about the continuation of daily operations.\n\n#####   Foresite	https://foresite.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cyber-security-2/		[]	False	[]	659	d

Use anti-DDoS software\n\n**Also, Read on: [Intrusion Prevention System](https://intellipaat.com/blog/intrusion-prevention-system/) to enhance your Knowledge!**\n\n### **30. Explain the XSS attack. How to prevent it?**\n\nCross-site scripting also known as XSS attack allows the attacker to pretend as a victimised user to carry out the actions that the user can perform, in turn, stealing any of the user’s data. If the attacker can masquerade as a privileged victimised user, one can gain full control over all the application’s data and functionality. Here, the attacker injects malicious client-side code into web services to steal information, run destructive code, take control of a user’s session, and perform a phishing scam.\n\nHere are the ways to prevent an XSS attack:\n\n1.  Cross-check the user’s input\n\n1.  Sanitize HTML \n\n1.  Employ anti-XSS tools\n\n1.  Use encoding \n\n1.  Check for regular updates of the software\n\n### **31. What is an ARP, and how does it work?**\n\nAddress Resolution Protocol is a communication protocol of the network layer in the OSI model. Its function is to find the [MAC address](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-mac-address/) for the given IP address of the system. It converts the IPv4 address, which is 32-bit, into a 48-bit MAC address.\n\nHow ARP works:\n\n1.  It sends an ARP request that broadcasts frames to the entire network.\n\n1.  All nodes on the network receive the ARP request.\n\n1.  The nodes check whether the request matches with the ARP table to find the target’s MAC address.\n\n1.  If it does not match, then the nodes silently discard the packet.\n\n1.  If it matches, the target will send an ARP response back to the original sender via unicast.\n\n### **32. What is port blocking within LAN?**\n\nPort blocking within LAN involves the act of preventing users from accessing a specific set of services within the local area network. The primary objective is to halt the source’s capability to grant access to destination nodes through ports. As all applications operate on ports, it becomes crucial to obstruct these ports in order to limit unauthorized access, which could potentially exploit security vulnerabilities within the network infrastructure.	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[]	706	dqwdwqqwd

What is a botnet?**\n\nA botnet, also called a robot network, is a malware that infects networks of computers and gets them under the control of a single attacker who is called a ‘bot herder.’ A bot is an individual machine that is under the control of bot herders. The attacker acts as a central party who can command every bot to perform simultaneous and coordinated criminal actions.\n\nA botnet is usually always responsible for large-scale attacks since a bot herder can control millions of bots at a time. All the bot can receive updates from the attacker to change their behavior in no time.\n\n### **35. What is a CSRF attack? How is it executed?**\n\nCross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack, also known as session riding or one-click attack, is a malicious exploit that tricks a victim into performing unintended actions on a website on which they are authenticated. It occurs when an attacker exploits the trust between a user’s browser and a targeted website. The attack takes advantage of the fact that websites often rely on cookies or other authentication credentials to verify a user’s identity.\n\nIn order to execute a CSRF attack, an attacker typically follows these steps:	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[{"DisplayOrder":0,"QnaId":708,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Identify the Target:"},{"DisplayOrder":1,"QnaId":709,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Craft the Malicious Payload:"},{"DisplayOrder":2,"QnaId":710,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Create a Malicious Website:"},{"DisplayOrder":3,"QnaId":711,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Exploit the Trust Relationship:"},{"DisplayOrder":4,"QnaId":712,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Victim Interaction:"},{"DisplayOrder":5,"QnaId":713,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Sending Forged Requests:"},{"DisplayOrder":6,"QnaId":714,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Exploiting Authentication:"},{"DisplayOrder":7,"QnaId":715,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Attack Success:"},{"DisplayOrder":8,"QnaId":716,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)"},{"DisplayOrder":9,"QnaId":717,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Transport Layer Security (TLS)"}]	707	dqwdwqqwd

The payload contains requests designed to mimic legitimate actions on the target website.	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[]	712	dqwdwqqwd
Sending Forged Requests:	1.  The victim’s browser automatically sends HTTP requests to the target website, carrying out actions on behalf of the victim. These requests can include changing account settings, making purchases, or performing any action that the victim’s account is authorized to do.	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[]	713	dqwdwqqwd
Exploiting Authentication:	1.  The target website receives the forged requests and processes them, assuming they are legitimate due to the victim’s authenticated session (e.g., session cookies) with the website. As a result, the actions requested by the attacker are performed on the victim’s behalf.	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[]	714	dqwdwqqwd
Attack Success:	1.  If the CSRF attack is successful, the attacker achieves their desired outcome, which can range from unauthorized actions to data theft, depending on the vulnerability and the attacker’s intentions.\n\n### **36. What are salted hashes?**\n\nWhen two users have the same password, it will result in the creation of the same password hashes. In such a case, an attacker can easily crack the password by performing a dictionary or brute-force attack. To avoid this, a salted hash is implemented.\n\nA salted hash is used to randomize hashes by prepending or appending a random string (salt) to the password before hashing. This results in the creation of two completely different hashes, which can be employed to protect the users’ passwords in the database against the attacker.\n\n### **37. What is ARP poisoning?**\n\nAddress Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing or ARP cache poisoning, is a type of cyber attack where an attacker manipulates the ARP tables on a local area network (LAN). The attack involves sending falsified ARP messages to associate the attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network, redirecting network traffic intended for that device to the attacker.\n\n### **38. Explain SSL and TLS.**	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[]	715	dqwdwqqwd
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)	It employs encryption algorithms to keep any sensitive data that is sent between a client and a server by scrambling the data in transit. This helps prevent hackers from reading any data, such as credit card details and personal and other financial information; it is done by keeping the i nternet connection secure.	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[]	716	dqwdwqqwd
Transport Layer Security (TLS)	TLS is the successor of SSL. It is an improved protocol version that works just like SSL to protect information transfer. However, to provide better security, both TLS and SSL are often implemented together. \n\n**Stay one step ahead: Enhance your knowledge of [application security](https://intellipaat.com/blog/application-security/) and proactively mitigate risks in your software!**\n\n### **39. What is data protection in transit vs data protection at rest?**\n\n| Data Protection in Transit | Data Protection at Rest |\n| --- | --- |\n| Data is transmitted across devices or networks | Data is stored in databases, local hard drives, or USBs |\n| Protects the data in transit with SSL and TLS | Protects the data at rest with firewalls, antiviruses, and good security practices |\n| You must protect the data in transit since it can become vulnerable to MITM attacks, eavesdropping, etc. | You should protect the data at rest to avoid possible data breaches even when stolen or downloaded |\n\n### **40. What is 2FA, and how can it be implemented for public websites?**\n\n[Two-factor authentication](https://intellipaat.com/blog/two-factor-authentication/) (2FA) requires a password, along with a unique form of identification like a login code via text message (SMS) or a mobile application, to verify a user. When the user enters the password, they are prompted to enter the security code to log in to the website. If the code mismatches, the user will be blocked from entering the website.	https://intellipaat.com/blog/interview-question/cyber-security-interview-questions/		[]	False	[{"DisplayOrder":0,"QnaId":718,"Qna":null,"DisplayText":"Examples of 2FA:"}]	717	dqwdwqqwd

It is to impart human knowledge to the cognitive system, which will be able to serve as a self-learning system. This helps identify the threats, determine their impact, and manifest reactive strategies.\n\n### **42. What is the difference between VPN and VLAN?**\n\n| Virtual Private Network | Virtual Local Area Network |\n| --- | --- |\n| Provides secure remote access to a company’s network resources | Used to group multiple computers that are geographically in different domains into the same geographical broadcast domain |\n| A network service | A way of subnetting the network |\n| Companies wishing to connect with their remote employees will use a VPN | Companies wishing to employ traffic control and easier management will use a VLAN |\n\n### **43. Explain phishing and how do you prevent it?**\n\nIn [phishing](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-phishing-attack/), an attacker masquerades as a trusted entity (as a legitimate person/company) to obtain sensitive information by manipulating the victim. It is achieved by any kind of user interaction, such as asking the victim to click on a malicious link and to download a risky attachment, to get confidential information such as credit card information, usernames, passwords, and network credentials. \n\nThe following are some of the ways to prevent phishing:\n\n1.  Install firewalls\n\n1.  Rotate passwords frequently\n\n1.  Do not click on or download from unknown sources\n\n1.  Get free anti-phishing tools\n\n1.  Do not provide your personal information on an unsecured/unknown site\n\n### **44. Explain SQL injection. How to prevent it?**\n\n[**SQL injection**](https://intellipaat.com/blog/tutorial/ethical-hacking-cyber-security-tutorial/sql-injection-wireless-network-hacking/) is an injection attack where an attacker executes malicious SQL commands in the database server, including MySQL, SQL Server, or Oracle, that runs behind a web application. The intent is to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data such as client information, personal information, intellectual property details, and so on. In this attack, the attacker can add, modify, and delete records in the database, which results in the loss of data integrity in an organization.\n\nWays to prevent SQL injection:\n\n1.  Limit providing read access to the database\n\n1.  Sanitize data with the limitation of special characters\n\n1.  Validate user inputs\n\n1.  Use prepared statements\n\n1.

Scenario-based Cyber Security Interview Questions and Answers	### **45. You have a suture from where you receive the following email from the help desk:**\n\n*Dear YYY,**We are deleting all inactive emails to create space for other new users. If you want to save your account data, please provide the following details: First Name and Last Name:**Email ID:**Password:**Date of Birth:**Alternate Email: Please submit the above detail by the end of the week to avoid any account termination. * The above email is an excellent illustration of phishing. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1.  A reputed organization will never ask for an employee’s personal information in the mail.\n\n1.  In a normal mail, the salutation is not done in a generalized manner. This happens only in spam emails where the attacker tricks you into ‘biting.’\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should never revert to a sender who demands personal information and passwords via emails, phone calls, text messages, and instant messages (IMs). You must not disclose your data to any external party even if the sender works for organizations such as ITS or UCSC. \n\n***Want to learn more about Cyber Security? Enroll in our ***[***Cyber Security Course***](https://intellipaat.com/cyber-security-course-certification/)*** now and practice essential cyber security interview questions!***\n\n### **46. You get an e-card in your mail from a friend. It asks you to download an attachment to view the card. What will you do? Justify your answer.**\n\n1.  Do not download the attachment as it may have viruses, malware, or bugs, which might corrupt your system.\n\n1.  Do not visit any links as they might redirect you to an unintended page.\n\n1.  As fake email addresses are common and easy to create, you should not perform any action like clicking/downloading any links, unless you confirm it with the actual person.\n\n1.  Many websites masquerade as legitimate sites to steal sensitive information, so you should be careful not to fall into the wrong hands.\n\n### **47. A staff member in a company subscribes to various free magazines. To activate the subscription, the first magazine asks her for her birth month, the second magazine asks for her birth year, and the third magazine asks for her maiden name. What do you deduce from the above situation? Justify your answer.**\n\nIt is highly likely that the above-mentioned three newsletters are from a parent company, which are distributed through different channels. It can be used to gather essential pieces of information that might look safe in the user’s eyes. However, this can be misused to sell personal information to carry out identity theft. It might further ask the user for the date of birth for the activation of the fourth newsletter.\n\nIn many scenarios, questions that involve personal details are unnecessary, and you should not provide them to any random person, company, or website unless it is for a legitimate purpose.\n\n### **48. Case study:In our computing labs and departments, the print billing system is typically linked to the user's login. Users log in, initiate print jobs, and subsequently receive a bill for the printed material, either individually or through their respective departments. Occasionally, individuals contact us to express their dissatisfaction with invoices for printing they claim they did not perform, only to discover that the bills are, in fact, accurate. Question: What do you believe could be the underlying issue in this situation?**\n\nTo avoid this situation, you should always sign out of all accounts, close the browser, and quit the programs when you use a shared or public computer. There are chances that an illegitimate user can retrieve your authorized data and perform actions on behalf of you without your knowledge when you keep the accounts in a logged-in state.\n[ ]()\n\n### **49. What is DMZ in cybersecurity?**\n\nDMZ stands for demilitarized zone. It is a network architecture that acts as a buffer zone between an organization’s internal network and an external or untrusted network, typically the internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to provide an additional layer of security by segregating and isolating certain systems or services that need to be accessible from the internet.\n\nThe DMZ is designed to host publicly accessible services such as web servers, email servers, or FTP servers that need to be accessed by users outside the organization. Placing these services in the DMZ separates them from the internal network, reducing the potential attack surface and minimizing the risk to sensitive resources and data. A DMZ is implemented using firewalls and [network segmentation](https://intellipaat.com/blog/network-segmentation/) techniques. \n\nTypically, two firewalls are employed: one facing the internet and another separating the DMZ from the internal network. The external-facing firewall allows limited and controlled inbound traffic to reach the DMZ, while the internal-facing firewall enforces strict rules to prevent unauthorized access from the DMZ to the internal network.\n\n### **50. Differentiate between DDoS and DoS attack.**\n\n| Parameters | DDoS Attack | DoS Attack |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Attack Method | DDoS attacks involve multiple sources, often compromised computers or devices forming a botnet. These sources collectively bombard the target with a massive volume of traffic or requests, making it difficult to mitigate the attack. | A single source or a small group of sources flood the target system or network with a high volume of traffic or requests, overwhelming its resources and causing service disruption or denial. |\n| Source of Attack | DDoS attacks utilize a distributed network of compromised devices, making it harder to identify and mitigate the attack. The sources are often geographically dispersed. | A DoS attack typically originates from a single source or a limited number of sources under the attacker’s control. |\n| Scale and Impact | DDoS attacks can generate an enormous volume of traffic, overwhelming even robust systems or networks. They have a larger scale and can lead to significant downtime, rendering services completely inaccessible. | Due to the limited resources of a single source or a few sources, a DoS attack generally has a smaller scale and impact. It may cause a temporary disruption or slowdown of services. |\n| Complexity and Coordination | DDoS attacks demand more resources, planning, and coordination to compromise multiple devices and coordinate the attack. They involve exploiting vulnerabilities and establishing control over a network of compromised machines. | Implementing a DoS attack requires less coordination and resources. It can be launched by an individual or a small group using readily available tools or scripts. |\n| Detection and Mitigation | DDoS attacks are more challenging to detect and mitigate due to the distributed nature of the attack traffic. Advanced DDoS mitigation solutions are required, involving traffic analysis, rate limiting, or employing cloud-based DDoS protection services. | Detecting and mitigating DoS attacks is relatively straightforward since the attack traffic often originates from a single or a few sources. Filtering or blocking the source IP addresses can help mitigate the attack. |\n| Motivation | DDoS attacks can have similar motivations as DoS attacks, but they are more frequently associated with organized crime, hacktivism, or state-sponsored actors attempting to cause widespread disruption or target specific organizations or infrastructure. | DoS attacks are often carried out by individuals or groups seeking to disrupt services, gain a competitive advantage, or settle personal grudges. |\n\n### **51. Case study: In your college computer lab, one of your friends logged into her email account. When she left the lab, she only logged out from her email account. Later, she received a notification that someone had re-accessed her account from the college computer system’s browser, which she has used to send emails. Question- How do you think this happened?**\n\nThere are two possible scenarios:\n\n1.  The attacker can visit the browser’s history to access her account if she hasn’t logged out.\n\n1.  Even if she has logged out but has not cleared the web cache (pages a browser saves to gain easy and quick access for the future)\n\n### **52. Case study: An employee’s bank account faces an error during a direct deposit procedure. Two different offices need to work on it to straighten this out. Office #1 contacts Office #2 by email to send the valid account information for the deposit. The employee now gives the bank confirmation that the error no longer exists. Question- What is wrong here?**\n\nAny sensitive information cannot be shared via email as it can lead to identity theft. This is because emails are mostly not private and secure. Sharing or sending personal information along the network is not recommended as the route can be easily tracked.\n\nIn such scenarios, the involved parties should call each other and work with ITS as a secure way of sending the information.\n\n**Check out this interesting blog on the **[**difference between Cyber Security and Information Security**](https://intellipaat.com/blog/information-security-vs-cyber-security/)**!**\n\n### **53. You see an unusual activity of the mouse pointer, which starts to move around on its own and clicks on various things on the desktop. What should you do in this situation?**\n\nA. Call any of the co-workers to seek help\n\nB. Disconnect the mouse\n\nC. Turn your computer off\n\nD. Inform the supervisor\n\nE. Disconnect your computer from the network\n\nF. Run anti-virus\n\nG. Select all the options that apply?\n\n### Which options would you choose?\n\nThe answer is (D) and (E). This kind of activity is surely suspicious as an unknown authority seems to have the access to control the computer remotely. In such cases, you should immediately report it to the respective supervisor. You can keep the computer disconnected from the network till help arrives.\n\n### **54. Check out the list of passwords below, which are pulled out from a database and choose the passwords that are in line with the UCSC’s password requirements:**\n\nA. Password1\n\nB. @#$)*&^%\n\nC. UcSc4Evr!\n\nD. akHGksmLN\n\n### Choose the passwords that are in line with the UCSC’s password requirements.\n\nThe answer is C (UcSc4Evr!). As per the UCSC requirements, a password should be:\n\n1.  Minimum of 8 characters in length\n\n1.  Having any of the three from these four types of characters: lower case, upper case, numbers, and special characters.\n\n### **55. The bank sends you an email, which says it has encountered a problem with your account. The email is provided with instructions and also a link to log in to the account so that you can fix it. What do you infer from the above situation? Explain.**\n\nIt appears to be an unsolicited email. You should report it as spam and move the email to the trash immediately in the respective web client you use (Yahoo Mail, Gmail, etc.). Before providing any bank-related credentials online, you should call the bank to check if the message is legitimate and is from the bank. \n\n### **56. In your IT company, employees are registering numerous complaints that the campus computers are delivering Viagra spam. To verify it, you check the reports, and it turns out to be correct. The computer program is automatically sending tons of spam emails without the owner’s knowledge. This happened because a hacker had installed a malicious program into the system. What are the reasons you think might have caused this incident? **\n\nThis type of attack happens when the password is hacked. To avoid this, whenever you set a password, always use a proper standard, i.e., use passwords that are at least 8-character length and have a combination of upper case/lower case letters, symbols/special characters, and numbers.\n\nOther scenarios of the above attack could be:\n\n1.  Dated antivirus software or the lack of it \n\n1.  Dated updates or security patches\n\nThat’s all for now!\n\nThis blog has listed answers to the most frequently asked Cyber Security interview questions.

What are the objectives of the proposal for a Cyber Solidarity Act?	In line with the [Council Conclusions on the EU's Cyber Posture](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/05/23/cyber-posture-council-approves-conclusions/) of May 2022 and as announced in the [Joint Cyber Defence Communication](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52022JC0049), the Commission has proposed an EU Cyber Solidarity Act.\n\nThe EU Cyber Solidarity Act includes a series of actions to strengthen solidarity and enhance coordinated EU detection and situational awareness, while at the same time supporting Member States' preparedness and response capabilities to significant or large-scale cybersecurity incidents, through:\n\n*   The **European Cyber Shield**, which will consist of a pan-European infrastructure of **Security Operation Centers (SOCs)**, to build and enhance coordinated detection and situational awareness capabilities.\n*   The **Cybersecurity Emergency Mechanism** to support Member States in preparing for and responding to major or large-scale cybersecurity incidents.\n*   **The Cybersecurity Incident Review Mechanism to** review and assess significant or large-scale incidents.\n\nThe Cyber Security Act will be supported by a total of €1.1 billion, of which about 2/3 will come from the EU budget.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	724	dwqdwq
How will the European Cyber Shield work?	The European Cyber Shield will consist of a pan-European infrastructure that connects Security Operations Centres (SOCs) spread across the EU.\n\nIt will strengthen capacities to analyse, detect and prevent cyber threats and to support the production of high-quality intelligence on cyber threats. This will be done using state-of-the-art tools, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics. These tools will be jointly procured by the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) in collaboration with national or cross-border SOCs.\n\nNational SOCs will make up the building blocks of the European Cyber Shield. These will be public bodies, designated by Member States, acting as gateways to other public and private organisations at national level for collecting and analysing information on cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n\nThe European Cyber Shield will ultimately be made up of several cross-border SOC platforms, each grouping together national SOCs from at least three Member States. Support from the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) will supplement national funding for the SOCs.\n\nThe first phase of establishing the European Cyber Shield is ongoing following a [Call for Expression of Interest](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/cybersecurity-eu-launches-first-phase-deployment-european-infrastructure-cross-border-security) for cross-border SOCs under the DEP Cybersecurity Work Programme 2021-2022.\n\nThe European Cyber Shield will build upon and complement the work of existing SOCs, Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and other relevant actors.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	725	dwqdwq
What is a Security Operations Centre (SOC)?	The EU Cybersecurity Strategy proposes to build, strengthen and interconnect cyber threat intelligence (CTI) capabilities across the European Union. Such capabilities involve monitoring, detection and analysis to prevent cyber threats and provide timely warnings to authorities and all relevant stakeholders.\n\nThese capabilities are typically ensured by public or private Security Operations Centres (SOCs). These centres work together with Computer Emergency Response Teams/Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CERTs/CSIRTs) and they are supported by external, specialised sources of intelligence on cyber threats.\n\nSOCs may include any entity or team tasked with detecting and acting on cyber threats.\n\nThe	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	726	dwqdwq
European Cyber Shield	will be made up of National SOCs, which are public bodies designated by Member States to fill this role at national level, as well as cross-border SOCs consisting of at least three national SOCs working together to pool cyber threat intelligence.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	727	dwqdwq
How will the Cybersecurity Emergency Mechanism work?	The Cybersecurity Emergency Mechanism will	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	728	dwqdwq
strengthen the EU's preparedness and response to cybersecurity incidents	. The support from the Mechanism is complementary to national resources and capabilities and other forms of support available at Union level.  \n\nThe Mechanism includes:\n\n*   **Preparedness actions, including ****testing entities operating in highly critical sectors (healthcare, transport, energy, etc.) for potential vulnerabilities**. The Commission, after consulting the NIS Cooperation Group and ENISA, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, will identify sectors and sub-sectors from which entities should be eligible to receive financial support for coordinated testing. EU funding will also support other preparedness actions not covered by coordinated testing.\n*   Support for **incident response and immediate recovery from significant and large-scale cybersecurity incidents**. Support will be provided through **the EU Cybersecurity Reserve** with services from trusted private providers. Such services include, among others, incident analysis or incident response coordination. In case of significant or large-scale cyber-incidents, at the request of Member States, these actions will support the response and immediate recovery of essential services.\n*   **Mutual assistance between national authorities** for situations when a Member State dispatches experts to assist another Member State in mitigating a cybersecurity incident.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	729	dwqdwq
What is preparedness under the Cyber Solidarity Act?	Cybersecurity preparedness means a state of readiness and capability enabling an effective rapid response to a significant or large-scale cybersecurity incident. This can be ensured through risk assessment for potential vulnerabilities and monitoring actions taken in advance.\n\nThe increasing impact of cybersecurity incidents represents a major threat to the functioning of technology and to the Single Market as whole. The quickly evolving threat landscape demands stronger preparedness at all levels of the EU's cybersecurity ecosystem.\n\nThe preparedness actions proposed in the Regulation promote a consistent approach and the strengthening of security across the EU and its internal market. Member States would receive support for testing and assessing entities operating in highly critical sectors. The sectors or subsectors will be selected at the EU level to ensure coordinated action.\n\nIn addition, the Regulation proposes support for other preparedness actions, not covered by the coordinated testing of entities operating in highly critical sectors. Those actions could cover support to various types of other national preparedness activities.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	730	dwqdwq
What is testing under the Cyber Solidarity Act?	The Cybersecurity Emergency Mechanism includes the cybersecurity testing of entities operating in highly critical sectors (healthcare, energy, transport, etc.) for potential vulnerabilities based on EU risk assessments and methodologies developed by the NIS Cooperation Group in cooperation with the Commission, ENISA, and the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy.\n\nThe selection of sectors and development of risk scenarios should take into account relevant EU-wide risk assessments and risk scenarios.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	731	dwqdwq
What are risk assessments and risk scenarios and what is their role?	The assessment of cybersecurity risks is fundamental in order to define the adoption of appropriate security measures to prevent and prepare for a cybersecurity incident.\n\nRisk assessment is a process consisting of risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation. A risk scenario is a visualisation of potential sequence of events that might have adverse impact on the functioning of the networks and information systems and on the EU as a whole.\n\nFor the purpose of selecting sectors from which entities should be subject to the coordinated preparedness testing, the EU Cyber Solidarity Act builds on a number of relevant EU-wide risk assessments and risk scenarios, such as for example the ongoing risk assessment as regards the communications and networks infrastructure in the Union following the Joint Ministerial Call of Nevers, and the risk evaluation conducted and risk scenarios built following the Council Conclusions on developing the Union's Cyber Posture.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	732	dwqdwq
Which services and entities will make up the EU Cybersecurity Reserve?	The aim of the EU Cybersecurity reserve is to support response actions and provide immediate support to recover from significant and large-scale cybersecurity incidents.\n\nThe EU Cybersecurity Reserve will consist of services from a selected pool of trusted private companies providing managed security services, such as incident analysis or incident response coordination. These companies will be ready and can be mobilized to support Member States in case of significant and large-scale cybersecurity incidents affecting entities covered by the [Directive on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive) (NIS2 Directive).\n\nThe providers of these services will be selected in a procurement procedure. The Cyber Solidarity Act sets out a series of principles and selection criteria that should be followed during such procedure. In order to support the Commission in establishing the EU Cybersecurity Reserve, ENISA, after consulting Member States and the Commission, will prepare a mapping of the services needed for the EU Cybersecurity Reserve.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	733	dwqdwq
How can the Member States make use of the EU Cybersecurity Reserve?	Upon the request of the Member States, the EU Cybersecurity Reserve will assist competent authorities in responding to significant or large-scale cybersecurity incidents, and in immediately recovering from such incidents.\n\nThe support from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve is complementary to national mitigating measures and support actions. Therefore, to receive support, the competent authority should also itself provide to the affected entity direct technical assistance, and other resources to assist the response and immediate recovery efforts.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	734	dwqdwq
How will the support for incident response work?	Once the Member State's request for support from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve is transmitted to the Commission and ENISA, the Commission, with the support of ENISA will assess it without delay. If the support is granted, the trusted service providers that form the EU Cybersecurity Reserve will offer support to Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) and other national competent authorities responsible for cyber crisis management. They will be able to use it to support entities operating in critical or highly critical sectors, according to the NIS 2 Directive, that suffer from the cybersecurity incident. The incident response services will complement the national efforts to respond to significant and large-scale incidents.\n\nSupport may also be provided to the EU institutions, bodies and agencies and should be complementary to efforts already made by the EU institutions to respond to a significant or large-scale incident.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	735	dwqdwq
What is the procedure for selecting trusted service providers?	The services from trusted private service providers for the Cybersecurity Reserve will be purchased via procurement procedure. The Cyber Solidarity Act provides for certain procurement principles and selection criteria for such providers, including:\n\n*   the highest degree of professional competence to provide the services;\n*   a framework to protect sensitive information;\n*   proof of transparent governing structure, demonstrating integrity and absence of conflict of interest;\n*   security cleared personnel; secure IT systems;\n*   attestable previous experience delivering services to national authorities and entities operating in the critical and highly critical sectors in the Union;\n*   availability and agility;\n*   providing the service in the local language;\n*   certification at the EU level once a European cybersecurity certification scheme for managed security service providers is in place.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	736	dwqdwq
What is the Incident Review Mechanism?	According to the proposed Cyber Solidarity Act, the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (EU-CyCLONe), the CSIRTs network, or the Commission may request that ENISA reviews and assesses a specific potential or ongoing significant or large-scale cybersecurity incident.\n\nWhen reviewing and assessing a specific incident, ENISA shall collaborate with relevant stakeholders, including representatives from the private sector, Member States and the Commission. ENISA will also consult managed security services providers, entities affected by cybersecurity incidents, and other relevant entities.\n\nAfter a review and assessment of an incident, ENISA shall deliver an incident review report to EU CyCLONe, the CSIRTs network and the Commission. In the report, ENISA shall address main causes and vulnerabilities of cybersecurity incidents, as well as lessons learned and, where appropriate, recommendations to improve Union's cyber posture.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	737	dwqdwq
Can non-EU countries receive support from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve?	Taking into account the unpredictable nature of cybersecurity attacks and the fact that they are often not contained in a specific geographical area and pose a high-risk of spill-over, the incident response support from the EU Cybersecurity Reserve	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	738	dwqdwq
will be made available to third countries associated to Digital Europe Programme,	in accordance with their respective association agreements to the programme.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	739	dwqdwq
What are the specific objectives of the Cybersecurity Skills Academy?	The Cybersecurity Skills Academy will increase the visibility of cybersecurity skills initiatives and help boosting numbers of skilled cybersecurity professionals in the EU to tackle the gap in cybersecurity professionals across the Member States.\n\nThe Academy will:\n\n*   **Work towards** **a common baseline for cybersecurity career profiles and the associated skills**. It will provide clarity on cybersecurity trainings and certifications to increase the number of cybersecurity professionals in Europe. It is also necessary to ensure that professionals undertake required quality trainings. With this in mind, the Commission will launch a pilot project to set up a European attestation system for cybersecurity skills.\n*   **Ensure a** **better channelling and visibility of the available funding opportunities** for cybersecurity skills-related activities to maximise their impact.\n*   **Call on stakeholders (e.g., companies, schools, universities and authorities) to take action** by making concrete pledges to initiate specific actions, such as to offer cybersecurity trainings and certifications, as well as integrating cybersecurity skills into their strategies.\n*   **Define indicators to monitor the evolution on the job market** for cybersecurity professionals, allowing training providers (such as schools, universities and organisations) to timely adapt their trainings and curricula to the market needs.\n\nThe Commission proposes that the Academy takes the shape of a European digital infrastructure consortium (EDIC), a new legal framework to implement multi-country projects. This possibility will now be discussed with Member States.\n\nIn the meantime, the Commission will create a single point of entry to the Academy through the [Digital Skills and Jobs Platform](https://digital-skills-jobs.europa.eu/en), giving access to relevant information, activities and stakeholders within the scope of the Academy.\n\nThe \n\n**EU Agency**	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	740	dwqdwq

What kind of trainings will the Academy showcase?	Initially, the Academy will gather existing education and training opportunities and give them visibility on the Digital Skills and Jobs Platform. \n\nFurthermore, the Commission will finance specific cybersecurity courses, through Erasmus+, joint Bachelor and Master degree programmes, joint courses or modules. As well as well intensive programmes combining online teaching with a short period of physical mobility.\n\nAs another example, along Academy's goals, ENISA will enhance its training offer by expanding its 'train the trainer' programme to public and private critical operators in the scope of the NIS2 Directive.\n\nThe European Security and Defence Centre will also review its training offer, designed for the cyber defence workforce.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	743	dwqdwq
Why it is so important to have one single entry point in EU?	There are numerous initiatives from public and private entities at European and national levels looking to boost the cybersecurity skills job market. Collecting and presenting them together on one page online would greatly increase their visibility and comparability. For one, a student or job seeker wishing to enter the cybersecurity field, or a professional willing to upskill or reskill may find it challenging to know where and how to start. An organisation looking for funding on cybersecurity skills has to navigate on several pages to find the information needed. Giving a single point of entry will make it easier for all those interested to have access to relevant information.	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	744	dwqdwq
How will the Cybersecurity Skills Academy be funded?	Initially, the Cybersecurity Skills Academy will benefit from €10 million of dedicated EU budget under the [Digital Europe Programme work programme 2023-2024](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/work-programmes-digital).\n\nThe Cybersecurity Skills Academy will facilitate the visibility of funding on cyber skills from relevant EU programmes (such as DEP, RRF, InvestEU, the European Social Fund Plus).\n\nShould the Academy take the shape of a	https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_23_2244		[]	False	[]	745	dwqdwq

What is cybersecurity?	Cybersecurity has emerged as a critical domain of global competition that reaches across the social, economic, political and military realms of influence.\n\nNational Security Presidential Directive 54/Homeland Security Directive 23 (NSPD-54/HSPD-23) defines cyberspace as the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, and includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers in critical industries. Common usage of the term also refers to the virtual environment of information and interactions between people.\n\nThis infusion of the Internet and its related networked technologies into nearly every aspect of society, business, and government presents a target of opportunity for adversaries. As a result, it is not surprising to see nations and assorted international organizations developing new operational doctrines, advanced cyberwarfare capabilities, and the necessary domain-focused human capital needed to achieve or maintain their interests in cyberspace.\n\nMeeting these challenges successfully requires developing qualified professionals who understand this environment and the risks (or opportunities) therein. UMBC stands ready to help build this next generation of cybersecurity professionals.	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	749	dwq
Why study cybersecurity at UMBC?	UMBC is uniquely positioned to provide education and training that respond to the state’s need for qualified technical professionals in the cybersecurity field:\n\nReputation and Affordability: UMBC continues to lead the U.S. News national university rankings for strong commitment to undergraduate teaching, tied with Yale at #6 on the list and ranked ahead of Stanford and Duke. In a new ranking of “Most Innovative Schools,” UMBC is #4 in the nation, joining MIT and Stanford in the top five. UMBC has again been honored as one of the world’s top higher education institutions by both the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) and Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), which focus on such qualities as faculty research output and major awards.\n\nIn 2015, Princeton Review featured UMBC in its 2015 Best Colleges Guide, highlighting UMBC’s standout academic reputation as a place where “students take education seriously.” As one student shared: “UMBC wants to see every student succeed—they provide you with the tools, people, and resources to make sure you get where you want to go in life.” Kiplinger’s Personal Finance and the selective Fiske Guide to Colleges have named UMBC a “Best Value” and a “Best Buy,” respectively. We’re a place where it’s cool to be smart, and where students can be confident investing in their education.\n\nAcademic Excellence: UMBC is dual-designated as an NSA/DHS Center of Academic Excellence for Cyber Defense Education (CDE) and Information Assurance Research. We are one of only a select few institutions holding multiple NSA/DHS designations for excellence in the cybersecurity discipline.\n\nThe CAE educational designation includes (among other elements) a certification that our curriculum satisfies focus areas and knowledge units (KUs) as outlined in the NICE Framework. This framework aims to establish a common lexicon for students, universities, and employers for describing knowledge and skills needed for various cybersecurity jobs. The CAE research designation signifies UMBC’s demonstrated excellence in conducting quality interdisciplinary research activities pertaining to cybersecurity.\n\nConvenient Location: UMBC is located off of I-95 near the BWI Airport, approximately ten miles from Fort Meade (future home of DISA and the U.S. Cyber Command). UMBC is convenient to a host of federal agencies and government contractors that need cyber-related research, education, and training.	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	750	dwq
What programs does UMBC offer in cybersecurity?	UMBC’s Graduate Cybersecurity program offerings (certificates and master’s degrees) can be found here.\n\nUMBC offers graduate cybersecurity programs at its Main Campus (Catonsville) and at the Universities at Shady Grove (Rockville).\n\nCurrent UMBC undergraduate and graduate students have the option of completing a track in cybersecurity as part of their degree programs. Contact Dr. Alan Sherman (sherman@umbc.edu) for information.\n\nCurrent UMBC undergraduate students have the option of applying to the BS/MPS program in their junior or senior year and may take up to nine graduate credits that can be applied to both their undergraduate and graduate degrees. Students benefit by shortening the time to degree completion, experience the cost savings of taking graduate courses at undergraduate tuition rates, experience flexible learning options (some courses taught in evening or in hybrid format) and gain practical knowledge and skills.\n\nMore info: https://www.umbc.edu/cyber/bsmps.php	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	751	dwq
How does a Master in Professional Studies degree (M.P.S.) differ from a Master of Science degree (M.S.)?	The M.P.S. is a master’s degree that combines management and courses with advanced study in a scientific or technical discipline. The M.P.S. Cybersecurity incorporates management and policy courses with more technical courses in order to prepare you for the human, political, and technical aspects being a cybersecurity professional. Rather than preparing you to perform pure research and/or pursue an academic career, this degree program is designed to help you advance your professional career.\n\nWhen developing this program, our Cybersecurity Advisory Board emphasized the need for educated employees who are both technically proficient and can communicate well, manage projects, and work successfully on teams. Accordingly, several classes include relevant group projects conducted both in-person as part of their syllabus. Thus, the M.P.S. combines the practical expertise of an M.B.A. with the technical knowledge of an M.S. degree.	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	752	dwq
How are UMBC’s cybersecurity programs courses delivered?	UMBC’s cybersecurity program courses are offered in lecture, hybrid, and/or online formats depending on the topic, program needs, and/or student interest. Classroom courses provide opportunities for rich interaction between instructors and students, and hybrid courses add the benefit of schedule flexibility by reducing the number of in-person class sessions. Hybrid courses replace up to 50% or more of class sessions with online activities that occur asynchronously (class does not convene online at a fixed time). In the online portions of a hybrid class, students work on self-paced activities and assignments (e.g., asynchronous discussion boards) or interact as part of small groups (e.g., discussions, chats/forums, project/assignments).	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	753	dwq
Where are courses held?	The UMBC Graduate Cybersecurity Program is not an online or distance-based program. Courses are held at UMBC’s Main Campus in Catonsville, the Universities at Shady Grove (USG) in Rockville, and online. Consult the Schedule of Classes for information on times and locations for classes during a given semester.	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	754	dwq

How can these programs help with my career development in a cyber-related field?	UMBC’s cybersecurity programs are designed for students and working professionals who aspire to make a difference in the security, stability, and functional agility of the national and global information infrastructure. Our graduate programs prepare students to create and lead processes, or serve as managers or team members in cyber-related fields within government, military and industry such as: Network and Information Security, Intelligence, Information Operations, Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence, System and Operational Requirements Analysis, Cybersecurity Procurement, Cybersecurity Exercise, Test and Evaluation	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	756	dwq
What’s the demand like for cybersecurity professionals?	The demand for professionals with cybersecurity expertise is strong and growing. Cybersecurity is critical to maintaining our national infrastructure—including the banking system, the stock market, the power grid, and military operations. The need for cyber-literate professionals is complex and crosses many fields in our region and around the world. From engineers and computer scientists to information technology professionals, policymakers, lawyers, and managers, qualified professionals are needed to manage cybersecurity operations in both the technical and policy domains.\n\nMaryland alone is home to a large concentration of cyber-related employment opportunities. From the federal government and national security community to private companies, as well as state and local government, at any given time there are thousands of unfilled cyber-related positions in our region for both entry-level and experienced professionals.	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	757	dwq
Can UMBC help me obtain a cybersecurity job?	While at UMBC, you may take advantage of UMBC’s Career Services Center and other special professional networking opportunities, job fairs, training programs, and related events related to the cybersecurity industry. We provide these tools and opportunities for students to explore and research the cybersecurity profession and enhance your ‘marketability’ and/or value as a cybersecurity practitioner. However it is up to you to take advantage of them as well as continue to learn about the field on your own outside of the classroom – a graduate degree alone will not automatically lead to employment in this field.	https://professionalprograms.umbc.edu/cybersecurity/faq/		[]	False	[]	758	dwq
