I'm the sole creator behind Progressor, taking on this project solo. I'm Hunter Reid, currently pursuing my capstone project at Yoobee Colleges. The guidance and support from my esteemed mentors—Arthur, Mohammad, and Rouwa—have been invaluable. Their insights have helped shape Progressor into the practical cybersecurity resource it is today.
